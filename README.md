# ProveSecAI Cyber Threat Graph Explorer

The TTP procedures are generated using Large Language Models (LLMs) trained to process and extract intelligence from vast quantities of unstructured data, including global threat intelligence reports, security news articles, incident reports, and research papers. They are built upon the **MITRE ATT&CK® Enterprise Matrix**, this resource transforms raw threat intelligence into actionable, graph-based data structures.

### Key Features and Value Proposition

* **Threat Data:** Contains a robust dataset of **over 2,000 unique cyber attack TTP procedures**, providing deep coverage across the entire threat landscape defined by the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
* **Graph-Based Intelligence:** Converts linear TTP descriptions into **visualizable graph structures**. This non-linear format is designed for intuitive exploration, clear understanding of attack chains, and simplified integration into automated tools.
* **Educational Resource:** Provides unparalleled clarity for educational purposes, allowing students, analysts, and researchers to **visualise complex attack sequences** and their logical dependencies.
* **Foundation for Automated Resilience:** Serves as the **high-quality, standardised input** for advanced cyber resilience and risk assessment tools, including our proprietary **TTPCRI** (TTP-based Cyber Resilience Index) assessment engine.
* **Versatile Threat Integration:** Easily adaptable to serve as a core threat intelligence component for **external risk assessment, security posture management, and breach and attack simulation (BAS)** platforms.

### How to Use This Repository

The core value lies within the **structured TTP procedure graphs**. You can leverage this data to:

1.  **Visualise:** Render the TTP graphs to understand the flow of sophisticated attacks.
2.  **Analyse:** Integrate the data into analytical tools for custom threat modelling.
3.  **Integrate:** Feed the graph data directly into your security assessment pipelines.
